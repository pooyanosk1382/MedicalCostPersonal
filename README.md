In here by using the dataset we create some regression models.
In all of them check the accuracy and get that the Support Vector Regression(SVR) is the best model for this data.
By checking the R squared formula we recognized that the SVR's R squared value is about 0.88 and has the best accuracy and also because 0.88 > 0.7 we get that this model is very good.
